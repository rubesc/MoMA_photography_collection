      <h2> Acqusition history: Photography vs. non-photography  </h2>
      
      <p> Photography, as a form of fine art, emerges relatively recently compared to traditional mediums like paintings and sculptures. 
        There's an enduring struggle for artistic recognition by photographers throughout the centuries. 
        Only in the mid-19th century did photography begin to be acknowledged as an aesthetic medium, by some.  
        Let's explore what MoMA's photography acquisitions can reveal about the journey of photography as a visual art medium.  
        
      </p>
   
      <p> On average, photography represents less than 30% of all of MoMA's acquisition.
      </p>

    <h2> Photography Acqusition Volume Trends </h2>  
    <p> How does ~30% of all acquisition translate into volume of purchase? It appears there's been a very slow growth with a handful of outlier years. For photography, the acquisition volume hovers around 200-400 per year.
      After the 90's, it jumps between 500 and 1,300 per year. There's one particular outlier year, 1968. That year MoMA purchased close to 5,000 items from French photographer Eugene Atgét's archive. Below, you can see an image from Atgét, "Eclipse", taken in 1911.

    <h2> Number of artist that are part of MoMA's collection</h2>  
      <p>  When looking at # of unique artist with work acquired each year, as opposed to number of art work, 
        we see that around 200-600 unique non-photography artists have work acquired by MoMA in recent year. 
        For photography, around 50-100 unique artists had MoMA acquired their work since 2010.
